# Game-React-App
React Gaming App â€“ Learning Project

This project is a React-based gaming application created as part of my personal learning path to master React. The focus of this project is to help me understand and apply key React concepts while building a fun and interactive gaming app. Throughout this project, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of:

React Components: Structuring reusable UI components for modular development.
State and Props: Managing game state and passing data between components.
React Hooks: Using hooks like useState and useEffect for dynamic updates and side effects.
Event Handling: Capturing and responding to user input in the game.
React Router: Navigating between different views in the app.
Animations: Adding basic animations to enhance the user experience.
